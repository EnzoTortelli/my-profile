		I was born and raised in the United States. I have led a pretty international life after moving to Spain at 14 and constantly visiting various places around the world throughout my vacations. I now live in Cergy to follow the Global BBA program at ESSEC Business School.

		<h2 class="Align">Achademic Path</h2>
	  <p>
		I studied in the US for around 11 years following the classic American system. At 14 years old, I moved to Spain and followed the International Baccalaureate (IB) program where I took high level: Physics, Math, and Economics. After graduating, I entered the Global BBA program at ESSEC. Currently, I am at the cusp of finising my first year and getting ready for my first internship.

    	<h2 class="Align">Sports</h2>
	  <p>
		Growing up and today, I still do many sports. I love endurance based sports such as biking, running, and swimming and have participated in Triathlons and duathlons. I also love extremem sports such as motocross, snowboarding, downhill mountain biking, and wakboarding. Due to these sports, i have suffered injuries such as 2 fractured legs, 1 badly fractured wrist, and two fractured arms. Neverthless, I still practice these sports to this day.

		<h2 class="Align">Peronality</h2>
	  <p>
		I am a very competitive person in most activities I do however tend to goof off a bit to much during other tasks. I am both a sports enthusiast and and a achademic person. I also enjoy always being around my friends.
